# TexasHoldem Final Project
I created Texas Hold 'Em in only python3.

## How To Setup: (ONLY WORKS FOR WINDOWS CURRENTLY)
1. Download the .zip file.
2. Make sure you download Python3, either at their website or on the microsoft store for free. (https://www.python.org/) <br>
I recommend the microsoft store because it automatically sets up pip, which you'll need.
3. After that's done, run the SETUP.bat and wait for the dependencies to download.
4. Then you should be able to play the game if you double click on main.py.

## How To Play:
You play as a player against 3 bots. The rules are the same as regular Texas Hold 'Em which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAoR9ji8D6A). The are several slight adjustments, there is no explicit check function, the call button acts as a way to call and check. At the end of a session when a winner is to be decided, it is completely manual when choosing who wins. To choose the person who wins simply click on the profile of the person who won. Profiles counter clockwise of the cards they are associated with. There is no way to end unless you and the all of the bots fold, so if you want to stop playing. Press the X at the top right of the window.
